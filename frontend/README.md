# Frontend Documentation

# My Mixed Project

This project consists of a Python backend and a JavaScript frontend. Below are the instructions for setting up and running both components.

## Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   ```
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Frontend Structure

- `src/index.js`: Entry point for the frontend application.
- `src/components/App.js`: Main React component containing the application logic and UI.

## Additional Information

For more details on the backend setup, please refer to the `backend/README.md` file.
